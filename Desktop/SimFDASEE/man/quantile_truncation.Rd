\title{Quantile-Based Truncation of Functional Data}
\usage{
quantile_truncation(data, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric matrix. Functional data with rows corresponding to time points and columns to spatial/grid points.}

\item{q}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Quantile threshold; rows with norms greater than or equal to this quantile are truncated.}
}
\value{
Integer vector of row indices of \code{data} exceeding the specified quantile threshold.
}
\description{
This function identifies observations (rows) in a functional data matrix
whose Euclidean norm exceeds a specified quantile threshold. These observations
are considered extreme and can be removed for robust statistical analysis.
}
\details{
The Euclidean norm of each row is computed to measure the magnitude of the functional observation.
Rows with norms greater than or equal to the \code{q}-th quantile are returned as truncation locations.
This is used as a preprocessing step for robust covariance estimation or functional data truncation.
}
\examples{
# Simulate functional data
set.seed(123)
data <- matrix(rnorm(50*100), nrow = 50, ncol = 100)
quantile_truncation(data, q = 0.95)
